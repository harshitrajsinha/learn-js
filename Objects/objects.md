# Definition
* Non-primitive datatype, stores data in the form of key-value pair.
* Two types of declaration - As a literal, using constructor
* Keys are implicitly changed to type string but values will have the type as that of value
  
# Singleton
* Object created using constructor can be singleton, not through literal declaraion.


# HC notes:
* object accessing - dot notation, square bracket (if typeof(key) === 'string' => accessing using bracket only)
* symbol as key value - declare a symbol -> use as key using square bracket -> access using square bracket
*
