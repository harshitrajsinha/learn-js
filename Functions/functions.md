# Definition
* Generic definition - Set of instructions that take certain arguments as input, process them and return an output.
* Arguments are passed to the function by value => any change in the value of the parameters inside function scope will not affect the arguments passed. However, this is not true in case of objects and arrays since the parameters are going to reference the same objects and arrays. [See example-1]


### HC code
* Hoisting in case of expression
* rest operator and return type of rest operator
* arrow function and this
* console.log(this) in regular function vs arrow function
* IFFE (watch video)
