* Primitive data-types - number, string, boolean, null, undefined, bigint, symbol => Pass by value
* Non-primitve data-types - array, object, function => Pass by reference
* Although Symbols are stored in heap memory, they are still treated as primitives in JavaScript. This means they are passed by value, not by reference.
