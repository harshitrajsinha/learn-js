# Two week plan to learn nodeJS from intermediate to advance

$$ Week 1: Foundation and Intermediate Concepts

DAY 1-2: Understanding Fundamentals
* Refresh your knowledge of basic JavaScript concepts.
* Install Node.js and npm on your machine.
* Learn about the event loop, non-blocking I/O, and the single-threaded nature of Node.js.
* Work through introductory tutorials to set up a simple Node.js application.

DAY 3-4: Asynchronous Programming
* Deep dive into asynchronous programming in Node.js using callbacks and the EventEmitters.
* Learn about the "error-first" callback pattern and how to handle errors effectively.
* Practice writing asynchronous code using callbacks.

DAY 5-6: Promises and Async/Await
* Explore Promises and the async/await syntax for handling asynchronous operations.
* Learn how to work with Promises to write cleaner and more readable asynchronous code.
* Refactor some of your earlier callback-based code using Promises and async/await.

DAY 7-8: Working with Express.js
* Start with the basics of Express.js, a popular web application framework for Node.js.
* Learn about routing, middleware, and creating RESTful APIs.
* Build a simple API using Express to reinforce your learning.

$$ Week 2: Advanced Concepts and Project Work

DAY 9-10: Database Integration
* Explore different database options for Node.js, such as MongoDB and PostgreSQL.
* Learn about database connection, querying, and integrating databases into your Express application.
* Build a project that involves database integration to solidify your skills.

DAY 11-12: Authentication and Authorization
* Learn about user authentication and authorization techniques.
* Explore libraries like Passport.js for authentication and role-based access control.
* Implement authentication and authorization in your Express project from the previous days.

DAY 13-14: Performance and Deployment
* Study strategies for optimizing the performance of Node.js applications.
* Learn about caching, load balancing, and other performance-enhancing techniques.
* Explore deployment options for Node.js applications, such as using platforms like Heroku or deploying to a cloud server (e.g., AWS or DigitalOcean).
* Deploy your completed project and make it accessible online.

TO LEARN:
* V8 engine and its working
* Global Execution
* Garbage collection - Mark & Sweep
